Hi all, 

Im currently working on an e-commerce project Shop to learn more on Typescript and also nextJS server actions.

<h1 className="underline">Tech Stack<h1>
nextJS: nextJS is an excellent framework that integrates seamlessly with Tailwind CSS and TypeScript, providing a streamlined and easy setup from the initial boilerplate.
MongoDB: MongoDB Atlas. Previously i used Vercel PostgreSQL as my database, and i like to try to use other sources. MongoDB is another popular choice, hence i set off to try to use it! Lucky me that MongoDB provided 1 x free use for test runs, or junior developers like me!
Prisma: Prisma as the ORM relational mapping between MongoDB and my main application. Prisma is also good to add seed data and schema along with tables into my main App!
Typescript Learning to use Typescript in this demo website. It helps to identify potential errors early on and save a lot of time in future as we should have already handled those exceptions that we may have missed out handling!

Feel free to check out the website!
