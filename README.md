Hi all, 

Im currently working on an e-commerce project Shop to learn more on Typescript and also nextJS server actions.

I am also using mongoDB, Prisma as my DB and ORM mapping respectively.

Things left to do: 
1) Responsiveness 
2) Finally launch to a hosting platform
3) Loading skeletion interface (to do tomorrow)
4) carousel banner at home page
